# Automatic-Water-Pumping-System-Using-Arduino-Nano
Many a time, we forget to switch off the motor pushing water into
the over head tank in our households. As a result water keeps over
flowing until we notice the overflow and switch off the pump. As the
over head tank is usually kept on the top most floor, it is
cumbersome to go up frequently to check water level in the over
head tank.

Automatic water level controllers are a product that was created to
automatically control a motor, which helps to ensure a constant
reserve of water in a storage tank. These automatic water level
controllers are used to automatically fill the over-head tank when it
starts or has become empty as well as monitor the water level in it.

Automatic water level controllers switch the motor on whenever the
water level drops below a certain level and shuts the motor off when
the water rises well above a fixed level. The motor will also switch
off when the sump water is exhausted before it fills the over-head
tank, or if the pump is running dry as well as maintains voltage
fluctuations.
